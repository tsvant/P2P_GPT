## P2P_GPT 🚀📚

Say goodbye to endless nights spent reading paper after paper. P2P_GPT (Papers-to-Paper) is here to make your life way easier. 🎉🎉

You provide a stack of research papers, and we return a shiny new scientific paper built from that knowledge. Like a friendly research assistant (but without the need for coffee breaks ☕️), P2P_GPT customizes its output to match your unique research goals.

"But, wait," you might ask, "how does that work?" 🤔

First, tear those scientific papers into bite-sized chunks – it's less messy than it sounds, promise! Then, our word sleuth GPT wades into this paper soup, fishing out the juicy bits like abstracts, authors, paper names, and the like.
Next, we strap on our analytical goggles and dive deeper into each chunk, sizing them up against your research goals like they're suspects in a line-up. The result? A tailor-made dossier of deep insights for each paper, leaving you feeling like you've pored over every page, without the eye strain! You get research objectives, literature review, research findings, table of contents for the future research of yours. No, we don't spit out a neatly summarized doc (yet!), but hey, where's the fun in spoon-feeding, right? 🕵️‍♂️📚🎉
Okay, the spoon-feeding is on the way as well anyways ahahaha

### How It Works 🛠

At the heart of our system is OpenAI's GPT-3 model, which is a powerful language model capable of understanding context. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how P2P_GPT works:

1. **File Processing**: P2P_GPT reads the full text of the research papers you provide and breaks them down into manageable chunks of text. Each chunk is saved into a separate file in a dedicated subfolder, named after the original paper. 📑

2. **Abstract and Metadata Extraction**: P2P_GPT uses GPT-3 to process each chunk and extract essential information such as abstracts, author names, paper names, places of publishing, and years of issue. This information is crucial for understanding the context of the content and is saved into separate files for easy reference. 🧐

3. **Goal Alignment Analysis**: With the abstract and other critical information in hand, P2P_GPT performs a "Goal alignment analysis." This involves comparing the content of the papers with your stated research goals to see how well they align. The results of this analysis are stored in a file for each paper. 🎯

4. **Step-by-Step Chunk Analysis**: In addition to the overall goal alignment analysis, P2P_GPT performs a detailed "Step by step chunk analysis" for each paper. This involves analyzing each chunk of text individually to see how well it aligns with your research goals. The results of this analysis are also stored in separate files for each chunk. 🕵️‍♂️

5. **Generate Research Findings**: P2P_GPT generates a file for each paper containing key research findings based on the alignment analysis and your research goals. These findings help summarize the most relevant information from the papers. 💡

6. **Generate Research Objectives and Table of Contents**: Based on your research goal and the research findings, P2P_GPT generates research objectives for your new paper. It also creates a structured table of contents, which outlines the structure and flow of your paper. 📝

7. **Generate Literature Review Fragments**: For each source used in the research, P2P_GPT generates a concise literature review fragment, critically evaluating the work based on the provided abstract and research findings. These fragments are saved for each source and are used in the creation of the final 'Literature Review' section. 📚

8. **Generate Final Literature Review**: Finally, P2P_GPT combines all literature review fragments and generates a comprehensive 'Literature Review' section based on the research objectives and your research goal. This section critically evaluates the works mentioned, summarizes the main points of view, and analyzes the influences on the formation of the researcher's own opinion. 📘

9. **Generate Final Research Findings**: In the end, P2P_GPT combines the research findings from all papers and generates a finalized research findings document. This document incorporates the key findings from each paper and provides a comprehensive summary based on your research goals. It ensures clarity, reproducibility, statistical significance, interpretation, discussion, transparency, and ethical considerations. 📝

In the end, P2P_GPT provides you with a valuable set of data that summarizes the key content of your papers, analyzes their alignment with your research goals, generates research objectives, a table of contents, literature review fragments, a final 'Literature Review' section, and comprehensive research findings. This information can guide your further research and writing process, saving you time and effort. 🏆🔬

### What's Next 🚀

This is only the beginning of a beautiful journey. We are continuously improving P2P_GPT and exploring new possibilities. Here are some of the features we are considering for the future:

- Full-length research paper generation (the real sci-fi stuff)
- That's it.

Happy researching! 🎉🎉
