Say goodbye to sleepless nights reading endless papers. Meet P2P_GPT (Papers-to-Paper GPT), the ultimate research tool that magically creates a new paper from your stack of research. Less coffee breaks than a your grad student research assistant, but with all the *write* skills.

## How It Works ðŸ› 

P2P_GPT performs like a Swiss Army knife in a jungle of academia:

1. **File Processing**: Carves your papers into bite-sized chunks. Akin to pre-chewed food.
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Even the introverted abstract and shy metadata can't hide. We find them. We extract them. We categorize.
3. **Goal Alignment**: Checks paper alignment with your goals better than a chiropractor with scoliosis.
4. **Chunk Analysis**: Evaluates each chunk, like a cheese critic.
5. **Research Findings Generation**: Extracts research findings faster than a pioneer on a gold rush.
6. **Literature Review & Main Body Generation**: Cooks up main sections and literature review, like a well-trained digital Gordon Ramsay. Always tasty, minus the 'F-words'. 
7. **Conclusion & Title Generation**: Spits out a concise conclusion and a catchy title. Silent, but deadly.
8. **List of Literature & Abstract Generation**: Rolls out references smoother than a yoga teacher navigating a complex pose. The abstract? You'll find it just breath-taking.
9. **Paper Generation**: In the end, stitches everything into a word-quilt that's academically warm and fluffy.

## What's Next ðŸš€

P2P_GPT's roadmap looks brighter than a bio-luminescent deep-sea creature:

1. **Multilingual Support**: More languages! AdiÃ³s, auf wiedersehen, au revoir to language barriers.
2. **More File Formats**: PDFs aren't books' yet-to-evolve cousin. We get it and we're on it.
3. **Customization** and **Peer-Review Simulation**: You comment on a particular section for it to be regenerated accordingly. Papa knows best.
4. **Integration with Digital Libraries**: My lawyer said not to mention specifics.

We've got your writing covered! Happy researching! ðŸŽ‰
