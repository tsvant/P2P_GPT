## P2P_GPT 🚀📚

Say goodbye to endless nights spent reading paper after paper. P2P_GPT (Papers-to-Paper) is here to make your life way easier. 🎉🎉

You provide a stack of research papers, and we return a shiny new scientific paper built from that knowledge. Like a friendly research assistant (but without the need for coffee breaks ☕️), P2P_GPT customizes its output to match your unique research goals.

"But, wait," you might ask, "how does that work?" 🤔

Well, it all starts with baby steps. We're taking the time to master abstract extraction for now, gradually squeezing meaningful juice out of the paper overflow. The goal? To deliver a summary that's so good, it's like you've read the whole thing.📖

## How It Works 🛠

At the heart of our system, we're leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3 model—a powerful language-predicting powerhouse. GPT-3 is excellent at understanding context, making it just the right tool for this job. 💪

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **File Processing**: The system reads the full text of the research papers you provide and breaks each one down into manageable chunks of text. Each chunk is saved into a separate file in a dedicated subfolder, which is named after the original paper. 📑

2. **Abstract and Metadata Extraction**: We then use GPT-3 to process each chunk. It's tasked with identifying any abstracts, author names, paper name, place of publishing, and year of issue in the text. This data is essential to understanding the context of the content and is saved into separate files for easy reference. 🧐

3. **Goal Alignment Analysis**: With the abstract and other critical information in hand, the system performs a "Goal alignment analysis". This involves comparing the content of the papers with your stated research goals to see how well they align. The results of this analysis are stored in a file for each paper. 🎯

4. **Step-by-Step Chunk Analysis**: In addition to the overall goal alignment analysis, the system also performs a detailed "Step by step chunk analysis" for each paper. This involves analyzing each chunk of text individually to see how well it aligns with your research goals. The results of this analysis are stored in separate files for each chunk. 🕵️‍♂️

In the end, you're left with a comprehensive set of data that summarizes the key content of your papers and provides insights into how well they align with your research goals. This valuable information can guide your further research and writing process. 🏆📝

## Coming Next 🚀

This is only the beginning of a beautiful journey. We're already dreaming up the next steps, such as full-text article summarization, complex argument identification, cross-paper idea reconciliation (the real sci-fi stuff) and a lot more. 🌌

Happy researching! 🎉🎉
