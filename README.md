## P2P_GPT

Say goodbye to endless nights spent reading paper after paper. P2P_GPT (Papers-to-Paper) is here to make your life way easier. 

You provide a stack of research papers, and we return a shiny new scientific paper built from that knowledge. Like a friendly research assistant (but without the need for coffee breaks), P2P_GPT customizes its output to match your unique research goals.

"But, wait," you might ask, "how does that work?" 

Well, it all starts with baby steps. We're taking the time to master abstract extraction for now, gradually squeezing meaningful juice out of paper overflow. The goal? To deliver a summary that's so good, it's like you've read the whole thing.

## How It Works

Underneath the hood, we're running with OpenAI's GPT-3 modelâ€”a powerful language-predicting powerhouse. GPT-3 is an absolute champ at understanding context, which makes it just the tool for the job.

The current setup reads the full text of your provided research papers, breaks them down into manageable chunks. These chunks are then meticulously processed to identify any abstracts they may be hiding. Finally, all of this knowledge is compiled into an intelligent, cohesive piece that you can call your own.


## Coming Next

This is only the beginning of a beautiful journey. We're already dreaming up the next steps, such as full-text article summarization, complex argument identification, cross-paper idea reconciliation (the real sci-fi stuff) and a lot more.


Happy researching!
